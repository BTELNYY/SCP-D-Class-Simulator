# SCP-D-Class-Simulator
A SCP unity game developed by me.

# Gameplay
This game will be a multiplayer or singleplayer puzzle/sandbox expierence. Specifically:

## Setting
You are a Class-D in the SCP Foundation (if your curious what that is, check [here](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/).

In short:
 Its a secret orginazation which attempts to contain unatural entities or objects (called 'SCPs'), in order to not destroy or cause the end of human normallcy

## Puzzle Levels
You as the Class-D test subject, must test various SCPs via simple tools (flashlights, radios, cameras, etc)

Currently deciding between fixed objectives, or end when you want. 

## Sandbox
You are given free roam of the facility with no objectives, you have a max tier keycard and can do anything you want, cross test SCPs, try to kill 682, fuck around with your friends etc.

## Breach mode
Imagine if Secret Lab had a fixed map and you could respawn based on spawn tickets for scientists and d-class.
